&lt;p&gt;This enchanted port city is filled with character, even if it’s shadowed in many people’s minds by the larger destination in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you enter Rotterdam whether that be on the plane or via car, you will notice the expansive financial centre consisting of skyscrapers such as the Maastoren. You will also see the Euromast, which appears &lt;a href=&quot;#euromast&quot;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cube-houses-kubuswoningen&quot;&gt;Cube Houses (Kubuswoningen)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cube Houses originated as a bizarre experiment by architect Piet Blom and was intended to show a crowded but comfortable living space akin to trees in a forest. As a result of large contingent of intrigued tourists regularly flocking to the houses, a show cube (Kijkkubus) has been set up to provide us with all the exploring we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost is €3 per person (as of 1st October 2016).&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kubuswoning.nl&quot;&gt;visit the official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.undiscoveredattractions.com/images/cube_houses.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wereldmuseum&quot;&gt;Wereldmuseum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In true undiscovered fashion, this museum hides in plain sight. The Wereldmuseum is a quirky conglomeration of different cultures and societies under one roof in the centre of Rotterdam. The price for this museum is a little steep, but is offset by a unique look at life all across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost is €15 per person (as of 1st October 2016)&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wereldmuseum.nl/en/home.html&quot;&gt;visit the official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.undiscoveredattractions.com/images/wereldmuseum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;euromast&quot;&gt;Euromast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the Euromast may not seem to be the type of attraction that should be on a website that is primarily for hidden attractions. Many people overlook this great attraction and it’s hard to see why. Offering views to Antwerp and The Hague on a sunny day, I believe this attraction is worth the cost. If you have time (and money) to kill, then a sunset meal at the rooftop restaurant would be the centrepiece of any trip to the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost is €9.50 per person&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euromast.nl/en/&quot;&gt;visit the official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.undiscoveredattractions.com/images/euromast.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kaapse-brouwers&quot;&gt;Kaapse Brouwers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final recommendation is the Kaapse Brouwers for all beer connoisseurs. Kaaspe Brouwers offers many local beers and is on the harbourside. If the weather is not good outside, they also have an indoor area too. There is often live music and it is a tranquil way to spend an afternoon in Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beers are generally around €6 each&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaapsebrouwers.nl/&quot;&gt;visit the official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-verdict&quot;&gt;Final Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Rotterdam should definitely be on many to do lists and hopefully these attractions should give you a base for an amazing city break.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Netherlands" /><category term="Rotterdam" /><summary>Rotterdam</summary></entry><entry><title>Brussels</title><link href="https://www.undiscoveredattractions.com/brussels/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Brussels" /><published>2016-10-20T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-10-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://www.undiscoveredattractions.com/brussels</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.undiscoveredattractions.com/brussels/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;brussels&quot;&gt;Brussels&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital of Belgium, Brussels is a capital full of character, different languages and different cultures all infused in one city. Brussels has its fair share of weird and wonderful attractions, whether that’s the Tram Museum in Woluwe St Pierre or the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken there’s something to do for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trammuseum&quot;&gt;Trammuseum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first item on our to-do list is the Trammuseum of Brussels. Originally intented to be a Transport Museum with exhibition halls, the Trammuseum of Brussels is a different attraction, even if it’s a little out of town (the Trammuseum is in the municipality of Woluwe-Saint-Pierre which is around 30 minutes from the city centre). Even so, it’s well worth a visit with one of the largest collections of Trams in Europe with around 90 on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before you go please check the opening times as the opening times can vary in winter&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cost is €8 per person (as of 1st November 2016).&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;http://trammuseum.brussels/en/&quot;&gt;visit the official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.undiscoveredattractions.com/images/trammuseum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;muse-du-jouet&quot;&gt;Musée du jouet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the former grounds of a large mansion, the Toy museum is the ideal place for anybody who has young children or are young at heart. Most of the information is in French but this is overcome by the large collection amassed by multiple enthusiasts over the years, of which many of the toys are recognisable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost is €6.50 per person (as of 1st November 2016). No official website&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tram-diner&quot;&gt;Tram Diner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rather bizzare fashion, a Tram has been converted for fine dining. You may be questioning why anybody would want to eat their evening meal in a tram but it’s certainely a unique experience that the tram diner offers. note that it is strictly reservation only. &lt;a href=&quot;https://visit.brussels/site/en/sites/tramexperience/&quot;&gt;More information here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;musee-schaerbeekois-de-la-biere&quot;&gt;Musee Schaerbeekois de la Biere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in or close to Schaerbeek, you must take a few minutes out to visit the beer museum. Run by a few locals, the museum now houses over 2000 bottles, with many other materials such as beer signs and glasses. Even if you couldn’t spend all day here, it’s well worth a visit if you are in the area. 
&lt;em&gt;Cost is €3 which includes a free beer tasting, open wednesdays and saturday Afternoons 2pm - 6pm, as of 1st november 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-verdict&quot;&gt;Final Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding unknown attractions in Brussels was very hard as there is so many that are known around the world. Wherever you go in Brussels, unknown or well-known, you will encounter an atmosphere that many cities around Europe have failed to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Belgium" /><category term="Brussels" /><summary>Brussels
